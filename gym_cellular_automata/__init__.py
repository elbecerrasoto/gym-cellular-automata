Gym Cellular Automata Enviroments
==================================

Gym Cellular Automata is a collection of
Reinforcement Learning Environments (RLEs)
that follow the OpenAI Gym API.

The available RLEs are based on Cellular Automata (CAs).
On them an Agent interacts with a CA,
by changing its cell states,
in a attempt to drive the emergent properties
of its grid.

```python
import gymnasium as gym
import gym_cellular_automata as gymca

# benchmark mode
env_id = gymca.envs[0]
env = gym.make(env_id, render_mode="human")

# prototype mode
ProtoEnv = gymca.prototypes[0]
env = ProtoEnv(nrows=42, ncols=42)
```

See https://github.com/elbecerrasoto/gym-cellular-automata for documentation.
